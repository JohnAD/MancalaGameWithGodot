# Mancala Game -- with Godot

This is an electronic Mancala Game app that plays by the Kalah rules.

It is for distribution on:
  * Android, via Google Play, and
  * IOS, via Apple Store.

This is a rewrite of a game I wrote back in 2017: https://github.com/PurpleSquirrelGames/MancalaGameApp. In fact, I will
probably release this rewrite under the same entry in Google Play.

# Frameworks Chosen

## Godot
  This framework provides the graphics, sound, and other capabilities and generates the files needed for distribution.
 
## Nim
  The game rules and AI code are written in Nim. It uses the "turn_based_game" and "Negamax" libraries.

this is my private property; so no you can't distrubute, modify, or publish it. But you can certainly use the _ideas_;
